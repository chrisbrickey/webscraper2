  {"id":"recEXpjs785j5Ls2G",
  "name":"Refuse Tax Reform without Tax Returns",
  "reason":
    "Trump unveiled his tax reform plan on April 26th, though the \"plan\" was merely a single printed page of ideas lacking the crucial details of what exact changes were to be made, how they were to be paid for, and the impact they would have on the economy and the average American tax payer. The main points that can be gleaned from what was introduced are that it wants to cut the business tax rate to 15% (currently 35%), it wants to eliminate the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax, and it wants to fight the House proposal to limit the tax benefit of debt that real estate companies enjoy. It would also greatly increase the deficit, not reduce it.\n\nIt is clear that Trump's tax plan does very little to help relieve middle class Americans of their financial burdens, but instead does a lot to provide gratuitous tax breaks to the wealthy -- people like Donald Trump, his family, and his friends. Eliminating the estate tax would directly benefit Trump's children who are among the fraction of a percentage of the population the tax applies to, and eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax would have reduced Trump's 2005 income tax (the only Trump tax information we have thanks to Rachel Maddow) by $31 million, 80% of the total amount he paid.\n\nDuring his press conference about the plan, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated definitively, \"The president has no intention\" of releasing his own tax returns, adding that Trump \"has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.\" Trump is the first president in 40 years to not release his tax returns, which makes Mnuchin's claim false. His statement also proves that Trump's reasoning for not releasing his tax returns never had anything to do with a supposed audit but was instead a blatant voluntary omission and con of the American people.\n\nWithout seeing Trump's tax returns, it is unclear how much Trump himself stands to personally gain from his tax reform plan, and the American people deserve to know if their President is prioritizing their financial welfare or his own.",

    "name":"Demand the FCC Maintains Net Neutrality",
    "reason":
      "Internet users scored a significant victory in 2015 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) installed protections for net neutrality and the \"open Internet.\" Net neutrality allows all users to have equal access to everything available on the Internet, and prevents Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from essentially turning the internet into cable television -- creating fast and slow speeds for sites of their choosing and charging consumers premium prices for upgraded access. Without net neutrality, small businesses, low-income individuals, and much of rural America would lose access to affordable, reasonably fast internet service.\n\nThe four major ISPs (Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and AT\u0026T) have been lobbying against the 2014 net neutrality regulations, frustrated by the constraints placed on their ability to profit from those who need their services the most. In response to their persuasions, the new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has pledged to roll back these net neutrality protections and instead rely on the ISPs to instead make voluntary, unenforceable commitments that they will maintain the open Internet. Congress needs to know that net neutrality is not up for debate and the open Internet must be preserved.",

      {"id":"reckLlSWncCOUjUed","name":"Stop Congress From Uninsuring Millions of People","reason":"House Republicans are attempting to revive the American Health Care Act (AHCA), their purported replacement for the Affordable Care Act. The original draft of the AHCA failed to make it to a floor vote because it would have caused 24 million people to lose insurance coverage while making coverage unaffordable for millions of others. \n\nDespite the bill's initial failure, House Republicans Mark Meadows and Tom MacArthur have proposed an amendment to the AHCA in the latest attempt to salvage the ill-conceived bill. The amendment would leave in place the AHCA's rollbacks of Medicaid expansion and premium increases for middle-class and older insurance buyers while giving states the option to end ACA protections for people with preexisting health conditions. Under this amendment, insurers could again refuse to insure people because of their medical history unless states prohibit doing so. \n\nThe amendment would also let states waive the ACA's community rating requirements, meaning insurers could charge people higher premiums for health coverage based on their health. Finally, the amendment would let states waive the requirement that insurance plans cover essential health benefits, including maternity care, mental health care, prescription drug coverage, and more, while letting insurance companies once again set lifetime spending caps on these benefits. \n\nThe amendment is so undesirable that its authors included a provision stating that it does not apply to the health care plan offered to members of Congress. If the amendment isn't good enough for these House Republicans, how is it acceptable for the American people? ","script":"Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].\n\nI'm calling to oppose HR 1628, the American Health Care Act.

Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney General for the Department of Justice, the #2 position within the department. This position is much more significant now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from all Trump campaign related investigations, as the entirety of the Trump-Russia investigation will now be spearheaded by the Deputy AG.\n\nDuring his confirmation process, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called upon Mr. Rosenstein to commit to appointing an independent special prosecutor to investigate Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, to which Mr. Rosenstein agreed to do, â€œIf one is required.â€\n\nOver the course of the last few weeks, the need for a special prosecutor has become clear. The House Intelligence Committee's investigation has been corrupted by Chairman Devin Nunesâ€™s partisan loyalty and politically motivated actions.

      //ISSUE 4
      {"id":"recBSEArPAkbgItoo","name":"No Nuclear Repository at Yucca Mountain","reason":"The history of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is long and deeply tied to politics. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Act, which established a methodology for identifying and screening potential nuclear waste disposal sites. The goal of this methodology was to ensure regional equality and fairness during the waste site selection process, during which ten locations around the US would be studied, with the intent of ultimately selecting two potential disposal sites, one in the Eastern United States, and one in the West. However, in 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Act to designate Yucca Mountain as the sole nuclear waste repository site, choosing not to examine any other potential sites for suitability.\n\nYucca Mountain was never identified as the \"best\" site for a waste repository by virtue of research and elimination, but rather as the result of politics--the nuclear power industry thought Nevada would not have the political capital to push back, but they were wrong. \n\nOpposition to Yucca Mountain serving as a nuclear waste facility is primarily due to concerns about geological safety. Nevada ranks 4th in the US for seismic activity, and in 2007 a fault line running directly under the Yucca Mountain facility was discovered. In addition to concerns about the safety of the repository site itself, most nuclear waste is generated in the South or Northeastern United States, necessitating transportation of radioactive material on trains and highways across the US.        \n\nEven though the Yucca Mountain Project was finally shuttered under the Obama administration after years of lawsuits, controversy, and safety concerns, the GOP and Trump have decided to bring it back to life. Trump has asked for $120M in budget funding and the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday, April 24th to consider a bill to revive the repository.","script":"Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY, ZIP]. \n\nI'm calling to express my opposition to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.

      {"id":"recG69PiCTgc9ZLxY","name":"Senate Intel Committee: Do Your Job and Investigate Russia Ties","reason":"On March 29, the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr (R-NC) and Mark Warner (D-VA) held a joint news conference where they portrayed themselves as ready to work together in a bipartisan effort to get to the bottom of Trumpâ€™s Russia ties. The following day, they held a rare public hearing where it became clear that a serious investigation was warranted and the committee would proceed accordingly. Burr, Warner and the committee received high praise for stating an intention to avoid the kind of partisan obstruction that has plagued the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nSince that time, however, the Senate Intel Committee's investigation of Trump-Russia ties has made little progress. Not only has the committee failed to issue a single subpoena, the committee also does not have staff members assigned to the investigation on a full time basis. The seven part-time staffers have no significant investigatory experience. Consequently, no interviews have been conducted and little tangible progress has been made. Chairman Burr has also failed to sign letters requesting pertinent documents from Trump campaign associates linked to the investigation.\n\nThe issue of whether Russia interfered with the 2016 Presidential Election investigation is one of the most important issues ever faced by the United States, and one that cannot fall victim to partisan priorities. There must be a credible, well staffed, and robust investigation into the interference. The Senate Intelligence Committee, and specifically Chairman Richard Burr, must put aside partisanship and conduct this investigation with integrity on behalf of the American people.","script":"Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY, ZIP]. \n\nI'm calling to express my concern that the committee is not sufficiently investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

      {"id":"recFlMoKlkl8pX6Jg","name":"Protect Overtime and the 40-hour Work Week - Committee Vote Weds ","reason":"UPDATE (4/26): The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has passed HR 1180. A full floor vote is expected before May 5th. \n\nHouse Republicans are pushing forward with a bill to strip workers of overtime protections and erode the 40-hour work week. For decades, under the landmark Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) most non-managerial employees have been guaranteed the right to time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a week. The misnamed 'Working Families Flexibility Act' (House: HR 1180; Senate: S 801) would give employers the option of offering these workers paid time off or 'comp time' instead of overtime wages if they work over 40 hours.\n\nMarketed as a way for workers with families to have more scheduling flexibility, in reality, the bill would give substantial new powers and flexibility to employers, creating gaping opportunities for abuse. While employers could make workers' schedules even more unpredictable, employees would have no guarantee of being able to actually use their comp time when they need it, even in case of emergencies. Furthermore, as Eileen Applebaum, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy research writes: \"In principle, a worker's agreement to receive comp time instead of overtime is supposed to be voluntary. But anyone who has worked a $10/hour job understands what it is to get an offer from your employer that you cannot refuse.\" While the act theoretically prohibits employers from intimidating, threatening, or coercing workers into a comp time agreement, it provides no funding to the Department of Labor for investigation or enforcement of violations.

      {"id":"recIY5BMUytUixNbV","name":"Defend Dodd-Frank Banking Industry Regulations","reason":"The Dodd-Frank Act is a financial reform law that was passed in 2010 as a response to the Great Recession. It includes a set of regulations intended to prevent â€œtoo-big-to-failâ€ banks from causing another economic crisis. One critical piece of legislation under Dodd-Frank is the Volcker rule, which prohibits banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, such as those that led to the housing market crash in 2008. The Volcker rule also limits banks in their relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which ensures that banks, lenders, credit card corporations, and other financial companies treat their customers fairly and protect consumers from practices like predatory payday lending. \n\nHouse Republicans have introduced legislation known as the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 that would repeal the Volcker rule and strip the CFPB of key enforcement powers, including the ability to fine institutions for unfair lending practices (which the CFPB recently used to fine Wells Fargo $100 million for opening 2 million accounts that their customers didn't know about). The repeal of the Volcker rule alone would increase big banks' profits by hundreds of millions of dollars a year while putting the American public at risk for another recession driven by irresponsible banking practices. \n\nThe House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold an initial hearing to discuss the Financial CHOICE Act on April 26th.","script":"Hi, my name is [Name] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [City, ZIP].\n\nI'm calling to express my opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, which would undermine the crucial consumer protections provided by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Using the obscure Congressional Review Act, the House has already passed a resolution to repeal the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) methane waste prevention rule put in place by the Obama Administration. The rule limits the amount of methane that can be vented, flared, or leaked onto public lands by oil and gas drilling companies. The amount of this methane waste not only affects the environment by filling the air with disease-causing pollutants and jeopardizing the purity of lands, but it also affects taxpayer revenue. The more methane that is wasted during the drilling process, the fewer natural gas royalties taxpayers can collect.

This $2.6 billion represents less than 15% of the estimated total cost of the project, which an internal Homeland Security memo has estimated to be at least $21.6 billion to complete over 3.5 years. Despite the wall's high cost, experts agree that it's the opposite of a solution to the nation's failed immigration policies.\n\nBipartisan opposition to the wallâ€™s construction is emerging; Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX) recently called the wall \"the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.\" Furthermore, the wall will likely be deadly. The existing border walls between the US and Mexico have already forced immigrants to take more dangerous routes to enter the country, such as tunneling underneath or traveling through the desert. Studies of border deaths have found that rates of border deaths increased with each new mile of wall constructed along the border since the 1990s.

      {"id":"recdrtW8ihk7eOJrH","name":"Keep Controversial Policy Riders Out of the 2017 Budget   ","reason":"Congress has until midnight on Friday, April 28th to agree on and pass a spending bill for the 2017 Fiscal Year (FY). If they fail to do this, the government will shut down. Because the consequences for not passing a spending bill are so grave, lawmakers are supposed to work together to make sure the bill passes on time. However, members of Congress sometimes take advantage of this position by attaching policies they would normally have difficulty passing to a bill that Congress has to pass unaltered, with no line-item veto available to the President. For example, defunding Planned Parenthood was previously attached to a Zika virus bill, which delayed its passage and the funding for necessary Zika virus aid, research and prevention.\n\nWhile Congress works to pass the 2017 FY spending bill, lawmakers may yet again attach policy riders from Trump's agenda. These may include defunding Planned Parenthood or EPA programs, or increased funding for deportation forces and Trump's border wall. Trump's Budget Director Mick Mulvaney may even withhold funding for Obamacare subsidies, a move that would make the entire healthcare system collapse, if funds are not allocating to the border wall. Trump is facing his \"First 100 Days\" deadline, also on April 28th, and is desperate to see some campaign promise victories this week. Now he is using the 2017 Budget as a means to accomplish such last minute, poorly planned goals.\n\nCongress must prioritize bipartisanship and pass a \"Clean Budget\" free of controversial policy riders that the majority of citizens do not want.","script":"Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY, ZIP]. \n\nI'm calling to urge [SENATOR/REP NAME] to pass a 2017 spending bill that is clean and does not include any controversial policy riders.

Eighty-three percent of all students attending US public universities graduate with debt, and some of them will remain in debt for their entire lives. \n\nA coalition of Representatives and Senators has introduced a bill to end the crushing burden of high college tuition. The College for All Act would provide free public university tuition for families earning up to $125,000 per year, covering about 80% of all US college students. The bill would also reduce student loan interest rates for new borrowers, allow existing borrowers to refinance at lower rates, and eliminate tuitions and fees at two-year community colleges. \n\nStudent loan debt prevents people from buying homes, starting families, saving for retirement, and working in lower-paying but crucial fields like social work and early childhood education.

Methods you can use with cta_aggregator_client:

This is from the README.md of cta_aggregator_client. Branch: feature/auth (master not yet ready)


List all CTAs:
    CTAAggregatorClient::CTA.list


List upcoming CTAs:
    CTAAggregatorClient::CTA.list(upcoming: true)


Find a CTA (may need this for adding resources after created a CTA):

    CTAAggregatorClient::CTA.find("some-uuid")

    the above ("string") is the id that cta_aggregator assigned when the CTA was created


To create (POST) a CTA., you will need to have an API Key and Secret.  Other users just email ctaaggregator@ragtag.org to get these.  I should see rake tasks in lib/tasks directory of cta_aggregator to figure out how to do this.

    attributes = {
    title: 'cool thing',
    descrition: 'blah, blah, blah',
    website: 'www.example.com',
    cta_type: "onsite",
    free: true,
    start_time: 1524175800,
    end_time: 1524186600,
    location_id: "df4aec9f-2ee9-4f53-8708-d32ad2c3babb",
    contact_id: "be7ba220-47b4-4450-b863-57b82481f2a9"
    call_script_id: "df62fbda-93b3-4f34-8a4c-5bf84564b699"
    }

    CTAAggregatorClient::CTA.create(attributes)


See the README.md file for examples of how to list all the resources, find resources, and create resources...which need to be done AFTER the CTA is created....


Create Location Note/Resource: (requires key + secret)
    attributes = {
      addres: '123 Fake Street',
      zipcode: '12345'
    }

    CTAAggregatorClient::Location.create(attributes)


Create CallScript Note/Resource: (requires key + secret)
    attributes = {
      text: 'Hello World.'
    }

    CTAAggregatorClient::CallScript.create(attributes)

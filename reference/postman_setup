POST: (not GET:)   url for locally running cta-aggregator
....usually http://localhost:3000/v1/ctas

Two headers:
Accept         application/vnd.api+json
Content-Type   application/vnd.api+json

I got the above from line 43 of cta-aggregator/features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb


Make sure "raw" dot is selected (4 options) because you are feeding it a raw json object.

Paste json object in "Body"
Click "Send" to test it
